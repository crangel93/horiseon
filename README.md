I made the html semantic by fixing proper indentation
All the elements follow a logical structure there were only a few things I had to fix though
I added alt to the img tags to say what that image was, what the text explained and what the links were
I made the heading follow a senquential order and fixed the title from website to the company's name
I added id tags to the search engine optimiazation, online reputation managment, social media marketing, lead generation, brand awareness, and cost managment
I put all of the attributes inside the css in alphabetical order.
I consolidated css rules that used the same properties.
